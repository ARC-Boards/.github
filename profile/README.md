**ARC (Applied Robotics Circuits) Boards** is a **student-led startup** based at  
**Gumaca National High School**, in **Gumaca, Quezon, Philippines**.  

We’re a team of young innovators passionate about **electronics, robotics, and hands-on learning**.  
Our goal is to make circuit boards that are **easy to use, educational, and inspiring**  
for students, hobbyists, and makers who want to bring their ideas to life.

### ⚙️ What We Do

We will design and share **open, educational circuit boards** that make learning and experimentation easier.  
We will also create **open-source firmware, schematics, and guides** to help others understand how things work —  
and how to build their own.

---

### 🌍 Our Vision

We aim to inspire curiosity and creativity by making technology more approachable.  
Through ARC Boards, we will help students discover the joy of building, experimenting,  
and solving problems through electronics.

---

### 🔭 Future Plans

We’re currently developing **ARC 1**, our first **prototype circuit board** —  
the foundation for future ARC Boards projects.  

**ARC 1 aims to be:**
- Simple and beginner-friendly  
- Compatible with common sensors and actuators  
- Reliable and versatile for different robotics and electronics projects  

Stay tuned for updates as development continues!
